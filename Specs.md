Below is a **consolidated, step-by-step specification** reflecting all the details we covered in our iterative Q&A. This document is designed to hand off to a developer so they can build an MVP that meets your requirements.

---

## 1. Overall Goals & User Roles

### 1.1 Primary User
- **Founder/Manager** of a small or medium enterprise (SME), using the MVP during facilitated workshops to:
  - Clarify and document their Business Model Canvas (BMC).
  - Identify uncertainties and relevant trends.
  - Generate future scenarios.
  - Define and monitor KPIs to detect when strategy adaptation is needed.

### 1.2 Coach Role (Future Phase)
- Although the MVP will not have a separate Coach role immediately, the system should be designed in a way that adding role-based features (e.g., multi-organization overview, permission settings) is possible in a later release.

---

## 2. Platform & Technology

- **MVP Type**: Web-based, responsive design suitable for desktop (initial priority). 
- **Future-Proofing**: Keep design responsive to accommodate tablets or phones later.
- **Data Storage**: No firm requirement—developer can choose a suitable approach (relational DB or NoSQL).
- **Scale & Performance**: A small user base initially (up to ~10 simultaneous users). Future scalability can be addressed in later phases.
- **Security & Compliance**: None specific for MVP; can be revisited later.

## 3. Core Functional Steps

### Step 1: BMC Data Gathering (Wizard)

1. **Wizard Structure**  
   2. Linear, step-by-step wizard that saves user progress.
   3. Mandatory fields are not strictly enforced; partial completion is allowed, but a progress bar and checklist show if any sections are incomplete.

2. **BMC Visualization**  
   2. **Interactive Drag-and-Drop**:
	 - A visual canvas with 9 BMC dimensions (Key Partners, Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Proposition, Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure, Revenue Streams).
	 - Allow **multiple cards** per dimension. Each card is distinct and can be added or edited.
   3. A **progress bar** displays how many dimensions/cards have been addressed.

3. **Numeric vs. Text Fields**  
   2. For **Cost Structure**, **Revenue Streams**, and **Value Proposition** (if containing numeric details):
	 - Collect relevant numeric data (budget breakdowns, revenue estimates, etc.) in structured fields.
   3. For other dimensions, free-text fields for describing key elements of the business model.

4. **Later Extension**:
   2. Excel/CSV import for financial data (not in MVP).

### Step 2: BMC Visualization & Overview

1. **Summary View**  
   2. After entering data, users can see a **visual layout** of their BMC with all the card placements.
2. **Quick Edits**  
   4. Users can click a card to edit text/numbers.
3. **Multiple Cards**  
   6. Each dimension can contain multiple cards. The layout should show them distinctly (e.g., stacked or side by side).

### Step 3: Uncertainties

1. **Separate Uncertainties Interface**  
   2. A dedicated screen listing each BMC dimension.
   3. Users add uncertainties linked to one or multiple dimensions.  
   4. Attributes to track: **probability**, **impact**, **timeline** (later updates possible).
2. **No History Tracking Initially**  
   6. Overwrite updates for now; version history may be added later.
3. **User & Facilitator Input**  
   8. For the MVP, only the Founder/Manager role is relevant; no special Coach role yet.

### Step 4: Trends

1. **Linking Trends to Uncertainties**  
   2. The system automatically **suggests** which trends might be relevant to an uncertainty, based on:
	 - A **built-in trend library** maintained by an administrative interface.
	 - **Keyword matching** or user selection.
2. **Trend Library Management**  
   4. **Admin Interface** to add/edit trends, define tags.
   5. **STEePLE Categories** (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, Ethical):
	 - Each trend can belong to **multiple STEePLE categories**.
	 - Display color-coded badges for each category.
   6. **User-Added Tags**:
	 - Users can add free-text tags on the fly.
	 - Must choose from or link to existing STEePLE categories (no new categories).
3. **Trend Probability & Impact**  
   8. Users map selected trends on a **probability vs. impact** matrix.
   9. Also shown as a **ranking table** with columns for probability, impact, etc.
   10. No drag-and-drop reordering on the matrix (probability/impact values are set via numeric or dropdown input, which determines the matrix position).

### Step 5: Future Scenarios

1. **Scenario Creation Flow**  
   2. System prompts user to pick top trends based on probability/impact ranking (default suggestion, user can override).
   3. System forms **axes** (e.g., “More regulation vs. Less regulation”).
2. **Automatic Scenario Generation**  
   5. The app auto-generates a **scenario narrative**:
	 - Includes perspective of a potential **customer**.
	 - Includes perspective of an **organizational member**.
	 - Ties back to relevant BMC dimensions.
   6. The user can **edit or challenge** the auto-generated narrative, adding or updating instructions as needed.
3. **SWOT Analysis**  
   8. The scenario concludes with a **SWOT** linking to BMC details:
	 - Summarize **Strengths** and **Opportunities** from the scenario.
	 - Highlight **Weaknesses** and **Threats** to be addressed.
   9. The user can incorporate or modify these suggestions.

### Step 6: KPI Dashboard & Triggers

1. **KPI Definition**  
   2. Users manually enter KPIs relevant to their business and scenario.
   3. Support **multiple thresholds** (e.g., watch zone, critical zone).
2. **Threshold & Alerts**  
   5. When a threshold is crossed:
	 - MVP: **Email notification** is sent.
	 - No automated strategy updates yet—user must revisit or adapt strategy manually.
3. **Future Evolution**  
   7. Later, the system could propose updated strategies, OGSM frameworks, etc.

## 4. Navigation & User Flow

1. **Linear Wizard (MVP)**  
   2. Steps 1 to 6 in a logical progression.  
   3. **Partial Completion** allowed; the user can skip ahead if they choose, but recommended to follow the wizard for first-time use.
2. **Progress Indicators**  
   5. **Progress bar** showing how many sections/cards are complete in each step.
   6. **Checklist** at each step so the user sees any pending items.

---

## 5. Feedback & Iteration

1. **Workshop Support**  
   2. MVP primarily used in facilitated workshops.
2. **Feedback Collection**  
   4. Email notifications at the end of major milestones prompting the user to fill out a short feedback form (web page link).
   5. Feedback data is captured for further iteration.

---

## 6. Administration & Trend Library

1. **Admin Interface**  
   2. Add/Edit **trend entries** with titles, descriptions, STEePLE category assignments, tags, etc.
   3. Users see and select from these trends to link with uncertainties.
2. **Tag Management**  
   5. STEePLE categories have unique colors or badges.  
   6. Additional free-text tags can be added, but must still map back to STEePLE for color-coding.

## 7. MVP Priorities & Future Features

1. **Included in MVP**
   2. Visual BMC wizard (drag-and-drop, multiple cards).
   3. Uncertainty list with probability, impact, timeline.
   4. Linking uncertainties to trends from a curated library.
   5. Probability/impact matrix for trends + ranking table.
   6. Auto-generated scenario narratives with user editing.
   7. Simple SWOT linking to BMC in scenario conclusion.

   2. Role-based multi-organization views (Coach).
   3. Excel/CSV data import for financials.
   4. Automatic strategy adaptation prompts, OGSM framework integration.
   5. Enhanced reporting (PDF exports, advanced analytics).
   6. Version history for uncertainties, scenario narratives, KPI changes.
   7. More advanced AI or text-generation features for scenario narratives.
   8. More robust design/branding elements.

## 9. Summary

This specification outlines the key features and user flow for your MVP:

1. **Step-by-Step Wizard** to build a BMC with drag-and-drop cards.
2. **Separate Uncertainties** interface mapping each uncertainty’s probability, impact, timeline, and linking them to trends.
3. **Trend Library** with STEePLE categories, updated via an admin interface, used to suggest relevant trends for uncertainties.
4. **Probability/Impact Matrix** to rank trends and define scenario axes.
5. **Auto-Generated Scenarios** with narrative arcs and SWOT analysis, allowing user edits.
6. **KPI Dashboard** with manual threshold settings and email alerts when thresholds are crossed.
7. **Email Feedback** prompts at the end of major steps for iterative improvements.

With this plan, a development team can create a focused MVP that captures essential functionality, while leaving room for future enhancements like role-based controls, advanced reporting, scenario evolution, and robust data import/export.
