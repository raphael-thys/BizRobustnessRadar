Below is a comprehensive, developer-ready specification that compiles our brainstorming findings into clear sections. This document covers user roles, functional requirements, UX flows/screens, architecture and data handling choices, error and edge-case strategies, and a testing plan to kickstart implementation.

---

# 1. Overview

The MVP is a web-based, responsive application designed primarily for founders/managers of SMEs. It guides users through building a Business Model Canvas (BMC), identifying uncertainties, linking them to trends, auto-generating future scenarios (with SWOT analysis), and defining KPIs with alerts. While the MVP will support a single user role, the design must be future-proof to include a separate Coach role (with multi-organization views and permission settings).

---

# 2. User Roles & Personas

### 2.1 Primary User: Founder/Manager
- **Goals:**  
  - Clarify and document their Business Model Canvas.
  - Identify uncertainties and emerging trends.
  - Generate future scenarios with auto-generated narratives.
  - Define and monitor KPIs, receiving email alerts when thresholds are crossed.
- **Workshop Use:** The tool is used during facilitated workshops, so the UI must be intuitive and guide the user through the process.

### 2.2 Future Role: Coach
- **Note:** Although not part of the MVP, the architecture and codebase must allow for easy integration of role-based features (e.g., multi-organization overviews, permission controls).

# 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 BMC Data Gathering (Wizard)
- **Wizard Structure:**
  - Linear, step-by-step flow.
  - Saves user progress continuously.
  - Allows partial completion (no strict mandatory field enforcement).
  - Provides a progress bar and checklist to indicate incomplete sections.
- **Data Entry:**
  - **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**  
    - Visual canvas representing 9 BMC dimensions (Key Partners, Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Proposition, Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure, Revenue Streams).
    - Each dimension supports multiple, distinct cards that can be added, edited, and repositioned.
  - **Field Types:**
    - **Numeric Fields:** For Cost Structure, Revenue Streams, and, where applicable, the Value Proposition (budget breakdowns, revenue estimates).
    - **Text Fields:** For descriptive input on other dimensions.
- **Future Extension:**  
  - Excel/CSV import for structured financial data.

### 3.2 BMC Visualization & Overview
- **Summary Screen:**
  - Displays a visual layout of the entire BMC, showing card placements per dimension.
  - Supports quick inline editing when a card is clicked.
  - Cards are visually grouped (e.g., stacked or side-by-side) to clearly differentiate multiple entries in each dimension.

### 3.3 Uncertainties Module
- **Interface:**
  - Separate screen listing each BMC dimension.
  - Users can add uncertainties linked to one or more dimensions.
- **Attributes:**
  - **Probability, Impact, Timeline:** Captured as numeric/dropdown values.
- **Behavior:**
  - No version history; updates overwrite previous entries.
  - Only the Founder/Manager role interacts with this module (no separate Coach logic in MVP).

### 3.4 Trends Module & Trend Library
- **Linking Trends:**
  - System automatically suggests relevant trends for each uncertainty based on keyword matching and user selection.
  - Suggestions are drawn from a built-in trend library.
- **Trend Library Management (Admin Interface):**
  - Ability to add/edit trends with fields for title, description, and associated tags.
  - **STEePLE Categories:**  
    - Each trend is tagged with one or more STEePLE categories (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, Ethical), which are displayed as color-coded badges.
  - **User-Added Tags:**  
    - Users can add free-text tags but must choose from or link to the pre-defined STEePLE categories.
- **Trend Ranking:**
  - Trends are mapped on a probability versus impact matrix.
  - A ranking table displays trends with columns for probability, impact, etc.
  - Matrix positions are determined by user-input numeric values (no drag-and-drop reordering).

### 3.5 Future Scenarios & SWOT Analysis
- **Scenario Creation:**
  - System prompts the user to select top trends (default suggestions based on ranking, with override options).
  - Automatically generates scenario axes (e.g., “More regulation vs. Less regulation”).
- **Scenario Generation:**
  - Auto-generates a narrative that:
    - Incorporates perspectives (e.g., potential customer, internal organizational member).
    - References relevant BMC dimensions.
  - Allows user editing and annotation of the narrative.
- **SWOT Analysis:**
  - Auto-generated SWOT summarizing:
    - **Strengths/Opportunities:** Derived from scenario insights.
    - **Weaknesses/Threats:** Highlighted for attention.
  - Users can modify the SWOT suggestions.

### 3.6 KPI Dashboard & Trigger Alerts
- **KPI Definition:**
  - Manual entry of KPIs relevant to the business and associated scenarios.
  - Supports multiple thresholds (e.g., “watch zone”, “critical zone”).
- **Alert Mechanism:**
  - When a KPI threshold is crossed, the system sends an email notification.
  - No automated strategy updates are triggered; the user must manually adapt.

### 3.7 Feedback Collection
- **Feedback Prompts:**
  - Email notifications are sent at the end of major milestones, prompting users to complete a short feedback form.
  - Feedback is collected and stored for iterative improvements.

# 5. Architecture & Technology Choices

### 5.1 Front-End
- **Framework:**  
  - Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular) for a responsive, component-based UI.
- **Design:**  
  - Responsive design tailored primarily for desktop with provisions for future mobile/tablet optimization.
- **Drag-and-Drop:**  
  - Utilize libraries (e.g., React DnD) for intuitive card management in the BMC wizard.

### 5.2 Back-End
- **Server-Side:**  
  - Node.js (or similar) to handle API requests and manage real-time data saving.
- **Data Storage:**  
  - Choice between a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) based on the data model:
    - **Relational DB:** If the BMC structure and relations between entities (uncertainties, trends, scenarios) need strict schemas.
    - **NoSQL:** If flexibility and rapid iteration are preferred.
- **Email Notification:**  
  - Integrate an SMTP service (e.g., SendGrid or Amazon SES) for alert emails and feedback prompts.

### 5.3 Future-Proofing
- **Role-Based Access:**  
  - Design the user model and API endpoints to easily accommodate additional roles (e.g., Coach).
- **Scalability:**  
  - Modular code structure and microservice-friendly architecture to allow future scalability beyond the initial 10 simultaneous users.

  - **User:** (id, role, name, email, etc.)
  - **BMC:**  
    - Dimensions (e.g., key_partners, key_activities, etc.)
    - Cards: (id, bmc_id, dimension, content, numeric_data if applicable, order/index)
  - **Uncertainty:**  
    - (id, linked_bmc_dimension(s), description, probability, impact, timeline)
  - **Trend:**  
    - (id, title, description, STEePLE_categories, tags, probability, impact)
  - **Scenario:**  
    - (id, selected_trends, narrative, axes, SWOT details)
  - **KPI:**  
    - (id, description, thresholds, current_value, status)
  - **Feedback:**  
    - (id, user_id, milestone, feedback_text, timestamp)
- **Relationships:**
  - BMC cards are linked to a specific BMC instance.
  - Uncertainties and KPIs can reference one or more BMC dimensions.
  - Trends are associated with uncertainties via tags/keywords.

### 6.2 Data Persistence & API Design
- **RESTful Endpoints:**  
  - CRUD endpoints for BMC data, uncertainties, trends, scenarios, KPIs, and feedback.
- **Real-Time Save:**  
  - Autosave mechanisms on each wizard step, with local state persistence in case of network failure.
- **Data Validation:**  
  - Server-side validation for numeric inputs, required fields (where applicable), and correct tag/category mapping.

# 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### 7.1 Error Handling Strategies
- **Client-Side:**
  - Inline form validation (e.g., numeric fields, required formatting).
  - Graceful degradation in the drag-and-drop interface (fallback to list view on unsupported browsers).
  - Notifications/pop-ups for unsaved progress or network interruptions.
- **Server-Side:**
  - API error responses with clear status codes and messages.
  - Retry mechanisms for autosave failures.
  - Logging of errors for debugging purposes.

### 7.2 Edge Case Analysis
- **Incomplete Data Entry:**  
  - Allow users to progress with partial data while visually flagging missing items via the checklist.
- **Concurrent Edits:**  
  - Although the user base is small, implement basic concurrency checks (e.g., version tokens) to prevent data overwrite.
- **Invalid Inputs:**  
  - Prevent non-numeric data in numeric fields and enforce valid date/timeline formats.
- **Network Failures:**  
  - Implement local caching of unsaved changes; prompt the user to retry or auto-resume upon reconnection.
- **Duplicate Entries:**  
  - Check for duplicate cards or KPI entries on submission and provide warnings.
- **Email Notification Failures:**  
  - Log and display errors to administrators; optionally queue notifications for later delivery.
